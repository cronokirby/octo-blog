One cool thing about lists is that they have canonical ways of consuming and
producing them: folds, and unfolds. It turns out that these are canonical,
in that folding and unfolding functions are themselves isomorphic to lists.
In this post, we'll explore why this is true.

This post will build on
[a previous post](/posts/2020/09/recursive-types-as-initial-algebras/)
I made a while back, so I'd recommend checking that out as well if this topic interests
you.

# Background Information

Our starting point is the standard definition of a list:

```haskell
data [a] = a : [a] | []
```

This recursive definition says that a list is either empty, or an element prepended
to a list. We also have the two fundamental fold and unfold operations:

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> r -> r) -> r -> [a] -> r
unfoldr :: (r -> Maybe (a, r)) -> r -> [a]
```

There's already some nice symmetry between the two, but there's actually **much more**
symmetry lying underneath this surface.

# List as Fix Point

As usual in Haskell, you can decompose a recursive definition into a functor,
which isn't recursive, and the "prototypical recursive type": `Fix`

```haskell
data Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))
```

For the case of list, we have:

```haskell
data L a r = Nil | Cons a r

type [a] = Fix (L a)
```

The `r` type in `L a r` represents the "recursive part". By taking `Fix` of `L a`,
we end up with something that is not only isomorphic to `[a]`, but structurally the
same thing. We have the exact same pattern of construction as the normal list.

# Fix as Initial Algebra

Roughly speaking, for an endofunctor $F$, an "$F$-Algebra" is going to be a tuple:

$$
(A, \epsilon_A : F A \to A)
$$
consisting of an object, along with an evaluation function,
from $F A$ to $A$. These algebras form a category, with morphisms being commutative diagrams
like this:

![](../Images/bbf3bed2bf6bb7d0d49894ae9cc5f3b287a6f62a568da20d12f7f63ce9d64fc4.png)

These are morphisms $\varphi : A \to B$ which respect the structure of the algebra.

What we learned last time is that $\text{Fix} F$ is nothing more than a concrete representation
of the initial object in this category. That is to say, there is a morphism $\text{Fix} F \to A$
for any other $F$-Algebra $A$.

# Fix is Terminal CoAlgebra

Similarly, for an endofunctor $F$, an "$F$-CoAlgebra" is going to be a tuple:

$$
(A, \alpha_A : A \to F A)
$$

where $A$ is an object, and $\alpha_A$ is a morphism from $A$ to $F A$ in the category over which $F$
is an endofunctor. This form a category, once again, with structure preserving morphisms.
The commutative diagram becomes:

![](../Images/b3fa5310d15676ad79c0143d465acf35c73cb8ab625bc728261cad49fce40187.png)

Now, my claim is that by *duality*, $\text{Fix} F$ is going to be a concrete representation
of the *terminal object* in this category. That is to say, there is a morphism $A \to \text{Fix} F$
for any $F$-CoAlgebra $A$.

I leave this without proof, because it seems somewhat natural that this would be true, it holds
in practice in Haskell-land, and this post isn't really about the Math anyways.

# In Abstract Haskell

In Haskell, we can represent an $F$-Algebra `a` as:

```haskell
(f a -> a)
```

A function `f a -> a` suffices to specify this specific algebra. To then say that `Fix f`
is initial, is to say there exists a function:

```haskell
Fix f -> a
```

provided that `a` is an $F$-Algebra. Passing this fact explicitly, we have a function:

```haskell
(f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a
Fix f -> (f a -> a) -> a
```

In fact:

```haskell
Fix f = forall a. (f a -> a) -> a
```

This initiality property completely characterizes `Fix f`

For CoAlgebras, we represent them as functions:

```haskell
(a -> f a)
```

The terminality of `Fix f` now means that there will be a function

```haskell
a -> Fix f
```

provided that `a` is a CoAlgebra. That means that there is a function:

```haskell
(a -> f a) -> a -> Fix f
```

In, fact, I claim that we have:

```haskell
exists a. (a -> f a, a) = Fix f
```

# For Lists

The two functions I want you to keep in mind are:

```haskell
-- initiality
(f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a

-- terminality
(a -> f a) -> a -> Fix f
```

These must exist, and in fact completely characterize `Fix f`.

Now, for the case of `[a]`, we have:

```haskell
(L a r -> r) -> [a] -> r

(r -> L a r) -> r -> [a]
```

as our characteristic functions.

Now, if you look at the definition of `L a r`:

```haskell
data L a r = Nil | Cons a r
```

You see that it is in fact isomorphic to `Maybe (a, r)`.
This means that our terminality function is nothing more than:

```haskell
(r -> Maybe (a, r)) -> r -> [a]
```

But this is nothing more than `unfoldr`!

Similarly, a consumer `L a r -> r` needs to provide a way to
handle both the `Nil` and the `Cons` cases. This means that
`L a r -> r` is isomorphic to `(r, a -> r -> r)`.
But then we have:

```haskell
(r, a -> r -> r) -> [a] -> r

(a -> r -> r) -> r -> [a] -> r
```

which is nothing more than `foldr`!

# Concrete Isomorphisms

Concretely, we can create two data types to represent folds and unfolds:

```haskell
data Fold a = Fold (forall r. (L a r -> r) -> r)

data Unfold a = forall r. Unfold r (r -> L a r)
```

The first data type, `Fold` encodes the characterization of `[a]` as the initial
object in the category of `L`-Algebras.

`Unfold` encodes the characterization of `[a]` as the terminal object in the category of
`L`-CoAlgebras.

Concretely, we'd like to prove the various isomorphisms between these objects
and `[a]`:

```haskell
list2Fold :: [a] -> Fold a
fold2List :: Fold a -> [a]

list2Unfold :: [a] -> Unfold a
unfold2List :: Unfold a -> [a]
```

two of these are actually very easy, and quite elegant:

```haskell
fold2List :: Fold a -> [a]
fold2List (Fold f) = f <| \case
  Nil -> []
  Cons a as -> a : as
  
list2Unfold :: [a] -> Unfold a
list2Unfold xs = Unfold xs <| \case
  [] -> Nil
  (a : as) -> Cons a as
```

I just find it amazing how strong the symmetry is between these two functions!
It feels like you're uncovering some kind of underlying beauty in the universe!

The other two are less elegant, but relatively straightforward:

```haskell
list2Fold :: [a] -> Fold a
list2Fold [] = Fold (\eps -> eps Nil)
list2Fold (a : as) =
  let Fold f = list2Fold as
  in Fold (\eps -> eps (Cons a (f eps)))
  
unfold2List :: Unfold a -> [a]
unfold2List (Unfold r f) =
  let go r' = case f r' of
        Nil -> []
        Cons a r'' -> a : go r''
  in go r
```

# Conclusion

These were just some rough notes about some insights I've had into
the duality of `foldr` and `unfoldr`, as well as their connection
with Algebras and CoAlgebras. Another point of exploration would be a
certain duality between `foldl` and `foldr`, but I'll save that for another day.
