# Abstract

> In this paper we introduce a rank $2$ lattice over a polynomial ring arising from the public key of the BIKE cryptosystem.
> The secret key is a sparse vector in this lattice.
> We study properties of this lattice and generalize the recovery of weak keys from "Weak keys for the quasi-cyclic MDPC public key encryption scheme".
> In particular, we show that they implicitly solved a shortest vector problem in the lattice we constructed.
> Rather than finding only a shortest vector, we obtain a reduced basis of the lattice which makes it possible to check for more weak keys.
