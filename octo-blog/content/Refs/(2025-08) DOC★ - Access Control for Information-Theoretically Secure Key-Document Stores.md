# Abstract

> This paper presents a novel key-based access control technique for secure outsourcing key-value stores where values correspond to documents that are indexed and accessed using keys. The proposed approach adopts Shamir’s secret-sharing that offers unconditional or information-theoretic security. It supports keyword-based document retrieval while preventing leakage of the data, access rights of users, or the size (i.e., volume of the output that satisfies a query). The proposed approach allows servers to detect (and abort) malicious clients from gaining unauthorized access to data, and prevents malicious servers from altering data undetected while ensuring efficient access – it takes 231.5ms over 5,000 keywords across 500,000 files
