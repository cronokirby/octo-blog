# Abstract

> The Regular Syndrome Decoding (RSD) problem, introduced nearly two decades ago, is a regular version of the Syndrome Decoding (SD) problem, where the noise vector is divided into consecutive, equally sized blocks, each containing exactly one noisy coordinate. Recently, RSD has gained renewed attention for its applications in Pseudorandom Correlation Generator (PCG) and more. Very recently, several works presented the improved algebraic approach (AGB for short) and ISD approach (including regular-ISD and regular-RP) to utilize the regular structure of noise vectors and provide a more precise security evaluation for the RSD problem.

> In this paper, we refine the AGB algorithm from a one-round process to a two-round process, and refer to the new algebraic algorithm as AGB 2.0. For each round, we guess a few noise-free positions, followed by a tailored partial XL algorithm. This interleaving strategy increases the probability of success by reducing the number of guessing noise-free positions and effectively lowers the problem's dimension in each round. By fine-tuning position guesses in each round and optimizing the aggregate running time, our AGB 2.0 algorithm reduces the concrete security of the RSD problem by up to $6$ bits for the parameter sets used in prior works, compared to the best-known attack. In particular, for a specific parameter set in Wolverine, the RSD security is $7$ bits below the $128$-bit target. We analyze the asymptotic complexity of algebraic attacks on the RSD problem over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ with the field size $|\mathbb{F}|>2$, when the noise rate $\rho$ and code rate $R$ satisfy $\rho + R < 1$. If $n \rho R^2 = O(1)$ where $n$ is the noise length, the RSD problem over $\mathbb{F}$ can be solved in polynomial time, but it does not hold for the SD problem. We show that the ISD and its variants, including regular-ISD and regular-RP, are asymptotically less efficient than AGB for solving RSD problems with $R = o(1/\log(n))$ and $|\mathbb{F}| > e^{n\rho R}$.
