A popularizing academic book arguing the case that [[American Gun Violence|gun violence in America]] is explained more so by [[Behavioral Economics]] than by traditional explanations of poverty, inherent criminality, insufficient regulation, etc. In other words, typical gun violence is not the result of a meditated choice, but rather the result of a brash decision in the heat of the moment, using a gun you happen to have to resolve a tense situation, with tragic results.

The book is well-researched, and does a good job of arguing its case positively, and rebutting alternative explanations of the phenomena. At times it can be repetitive however, and it constrains the thinking about impulsive decisions far too much to a narrow “System 1 vs System 2” framework, when in reality there are many more factors at play. The notion that unfortunate equilibria might exist, wherein it is both rational to possess a gun to defend yourself, and where you may not be able to rely on external help to defuse a situation, is hinted at but not explored much.

Worth a read, but I would feel free to gloss over some of the more repetitive sections, especially if you’re familiar with the points being made.
