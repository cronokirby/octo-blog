A harrowing account of a hypothetical [[Nuclear War]], triggered by a North Korean strike against the USA. Presents a scenario of how events would play out, minute-by-minute, with an intricate exposition of the various actors involved: military bases, missile commands, the chain-of-command terminating with the President, etc.

A takeaway is just how quickly things can escalate, and how difficult it is to coordinate action across nations in a credible way. Once the ball is rolling, it's very difficult to salvage and avoid total catastrophe.
