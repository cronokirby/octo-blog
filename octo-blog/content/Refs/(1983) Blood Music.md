A short story about bio-hacking. Almost like [[(1954) Horton Hears a Who!]], but in horror form. The premise is that our protagonist’s friend ends up injecting themselves with an experimental gene treatment, which makes his cells individually as intelligent as a human being, and capable of becoming even more so. This results in his body becoming, to a human, the equivalent of an inter-galactic civilization. This doesn’t end well, as you can imagine.
