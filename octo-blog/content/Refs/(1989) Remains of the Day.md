Touching and subtle novel, exploring honor and duty through the life of a Butler serving a great house in inter-war England. The novel has a distinct voice, that of our main character, who remains stalwart and very professional about the events of the book, almost to a fault. Nonetheless, our author manages to hint at much deeper emotions underneath this facade, which gives this novel a rich texture.
