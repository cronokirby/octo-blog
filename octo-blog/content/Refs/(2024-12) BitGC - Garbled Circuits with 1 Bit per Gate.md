# Abstract

> We present BitGC, a garbling scheme for Boolean circuits with 1 bit per gate communication based on either ring learning with errors (RLWE) or NTRU assumption, with key-dependent message security. The garbling consists of 1) a homomorphically encrypted seed that can be expanded to encryption of many pseudo-random bits and 2) one-bit stitching information per gate to reconstruct garbled tables from the expanded ciphertexts. By using low-complexity PRGs, both the garbling and evaluation of each gate require only O(1) homomorphic addition/multiplication operations without bootstrapping.
