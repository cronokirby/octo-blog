Very atmospheric and brooding [[Vietnam War]] trauma story (despite taking place in South America, the allegory is obvious). Does a good job portraying the savagery and cruelty of war, and the dehumanization you experience. Iâ€™m not sure if the amphetamine use was some kind of metaphor for the war-lust that gets imprinted on you, or was just meant literally, but it tied the story together well, right up until the ending, which was also tightly executed.
