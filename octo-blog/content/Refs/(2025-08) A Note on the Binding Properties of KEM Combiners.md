# Abstract

> In this note we analyze the various binding properties of combiners for KEMs. We show that several properties follow easily for the most general combiner—assuming a collision-resistant hash function—while more performance-oriented versions require the respective property from one or both of the underlying KEMs. Other properties are not obtained as directly and require either more properties of one underlying KEM or the respective property from both KEMs.
