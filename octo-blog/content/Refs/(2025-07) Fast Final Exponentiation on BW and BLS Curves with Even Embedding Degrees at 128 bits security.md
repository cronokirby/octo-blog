# Abstract

> The final exponentiation is a crucial step in pairing computations, ensuring cor-
> rectness and uniqueness of results in pairing-based cryptographic protocols. In
> this work, we propose an efficient method for computing the hard part of the final
> exponentiation on BW10-511, BW14-351 and BLS12 curves at 128 bits security
> level. Our approach reduces the computation cost by optimizing the exponenti-
> ation sequence and minimizing the number of required multiplications through
> an improved addition chain strategy. The computation cost of our method for
> the final exponentiation on these curves is about 25.6%, 33.2% and 10% faster
> than the previously fastest result on BW10-511, BW14-351 and BLS12 curves
> respectively. The correctness of our formulas has been verified by a Magma code.
