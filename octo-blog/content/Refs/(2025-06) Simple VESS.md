# Abstract

> We present a scheme for verifiably encrypting a Shamir secret sharing to a committee of shareholders.  Such a scheme can be used to easily implement distributed key generation (DKG) and resharing protocols used in threshold signing and decryption protocols.  Our scheme is a minor variation on known techniques, and is not the most efficient in terms of communication and computational complexity.  However, it is extremely simple and easy to implement.  Moreover, for moderately sized shareholder committees of up to, say, 13 parties or so, and for applications where a DKG/resharing only needs to be performed occasionally, its performance should be acceptable in practice.
