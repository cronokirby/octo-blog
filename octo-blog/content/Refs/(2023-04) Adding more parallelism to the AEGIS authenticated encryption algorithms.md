# Abstract

> While the round function of the AEGIS authenticated encryption algorithms is highly parallelizable, their mode of operation is not.
> 
> We introduce two new modes to overcome that limitation: AEGIS-128X and AEGIS-256X, that require minimal changes to existing implementations and retain the security properties of AEGIS-128L and AEGIS-256.
