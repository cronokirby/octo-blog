A literary novel, centered around the fictional Oregon coast town of *Searoad*, and consisting of a collection of disparate narratives of the Women living or passing through there.

I enjoyed this book a lot ; the prose was very charming, and meditative, and the themes were very moving. The novel is certainly very feminist, but in a way that felt personal and authentic, and not forced. The structure of the novel is one that I personally enjoy, but at times it does feel like a collection of short fiction pieces that share a common theme, rather than a cohesive novel.
