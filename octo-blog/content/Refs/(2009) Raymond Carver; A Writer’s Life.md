A thoroughly researched biography of [[Raymond Carver]]’s life. The book is meticulously researched, almost too a fault: while many details embellish the writer’s stories, too much time is given to uninteresting periods of his life, and the book fails to elevate itself from mere documentation into a story. Nonetheless, it’s not a bad read for fans of Carver.
