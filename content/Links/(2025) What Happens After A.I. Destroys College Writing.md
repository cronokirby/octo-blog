> The demise of the English paper will end a long intellectual tradition, but it’s also an opportunity to reëxamine the purpose of higher education.

Articles bemoaning the state of higher education post-ChatGPT are almost cliché at this point, but I found this one to stand out in its accurate portrayal of the students and professors engaged in this new reality. It’s interesting to see how students lean on AI as a crutch, out-sourcing their thinking. Another phenomenon I don’t see discussed as much is [[Anxious AI Assistant Use|anxious ai assistant use]], in that many students reported on here use AI reflexively to the point of wasting time sucked into meaningless conversations.

More than other articles I’ve read on the topic, this really gives me the sense of us living in a new world. And where also would you get quotes from brilliant scholars such as “Honestly, yeah. I’m not tryin’ to type all that. Could you tell?”.
