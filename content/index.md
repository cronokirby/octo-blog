Hello! This blog is currently a work in progress, but should hopefully replace my old blog, [https://cronokirby.com](), eventually.

# About
I’m currently a core protocol engineer at Penumbra Labs, working on [Penumbra](https://penumbra.zone) a private payments network. Beyond that, I’m a generalist software engineer and cryptographer, and like to dabble in a few different things.
