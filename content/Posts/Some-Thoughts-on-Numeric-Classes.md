This is just a quick post, crystallizing some of the ideas I've had recently
about organizing numeric classes in Haskell.

<!--more-->

These classes are the usual way of overloading the familiar arithmetic
operators (`+, -, *` and their buddies) for various types. Personally,
I think that they could benefit from a bit of spring cleaning.

# Haskell's Hierarchy

Here's an overview of Haskell's hierarchy of typeclasses:
![](../Images/ef2c9cbf9ee5963dda585761310334d2a521725fe027355f23983be1d8996cc4.png)

You can see the different typeclasses involved, and the dependencies
linking all of them together.

## Eq

The first class is [`Eq`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-Eq.html),
giving us decideable equality for a type:

```haskell
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> a
```

Naturally, this defines the `==` operator we all know and love. This
must be an equivalence relation, satisfying:

```haskell
x == x
x == y -> y == x
x == y, y = z -> x = z
```

## Ord

Then you have [`Ord`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-Ord.html),
which augments `Eq` with comparisons:

```haskell
class Eq a => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
```

(I've simplified things a bit here)

And the `Ordering` type is a simple enumeration:

```haskell
data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
```

It's clear that `Ord` should entail `Eq`, since we can just check whether
compare returns `EQ` for equality.

Using `compare`, the standard comparison operators `<, >, <=, >=` can all be provided.
While `Ord` doesn't specify any laws itself, it's common to assume that `<=` is
a partial order, satisfying:

```haskell
x <= x
x <= y, y <= z -> x <= z
```

## Semigroup

Now we get to the "algebraic" classes.

The first of these is [`Semigroup`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html):

```haskell
class Semigroup a where
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a
```

The only thing we assume about this operator is its associtivity:

```haskell
a <> (b <> c) = (a <> b) <> c
```

## Monoid

[`Monoid`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-Monoid.html)
augments the `Semigroup` class with an identity element:

```haskell
class Semigroup  a => Monoid a where
  mempty :: a
```

This element satisfies:

```haskell
x <> mempty = x
mempty <> x = x
```

## Enum

Next, we have the [`Enum`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Enum) class:

```haskell
class Enum a where
  toEnum :: Int -> a
  fromEnum :: a -> Int
```

The main purpose of this class is to provide semantics for the
`[a..b]` syntax. Otherwise, this is more of a pragmatic class, instead of
one with some underlying algebraic idea.

## Num

And now we have the infamous [`Num`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Num) class:

```haskell
class Num a where
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
  (*) :: a -> a -> a
  negate :: a -> a
  abs :: a -> a
  signum :: a -> a
  fromInteger :: Integer -> a
```

This is a big amalgamation of everything you'd expect numbers to be, and
then some more. The main purpose of this is to interpret the operators
mentioned here, including `-` as well, and to interpret numeric literals,
like `3`, or `420`, using the `fromInteger` method.

In my opinion, this class is pretty ugly, and perhaps my central motivation
in wanting to think about some ways to reform this hierarchy.

## Real

Now, you have another ad-hoc class, called [`Real`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Num):

```haskell
class (Num a, Ord a) => Real a where
  toRational :: a -> Rational
```

I confess that I've never used this class all that much. Ostensibly,
its purpose is just to provide a means to convert some type into
rational numbers, which provides a direct means for comparision,
hence the `Ord` instance.

If we can think of elements of a type as being rational numbers, it'd make
sense to also stipulate that they're numbers, using the inferred operations.
The `Num` requirement makes sense, under this interpretation.

## Integral

Finally, we have the [`Integral`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Integral)
class:

```haskell
class (Real a, Enum a) => Integral a where
  quotRem :: a -> a -> (a, a)
  toInteger :: a -> Integer
```

(Simplifying a bit here, but these form a complete definition).

Basically, this is for types that are equivalent to integers, and we have the
corresponding division operations we expect to have for integers:
`mod, div` et alii.

# Interlude: Two Worlds

So far, we've seen a basic overview of the numeric hierarchy. For the most part,
it gets the job done. We can calculate useful things, while also being somewhat
generic over the numeric types we use. This allows Haskell to have a principled
approach towards providing standard arithmetic for the various integer types,
like `Word`, `Int`, `Int64`, etc.

That being said, I think there are a few thorns with the organization of these classes. Analyzing the structure of the hierarchy a bit more can help illuminate
these issues.

## The Mathematical Classes

There are a few classes that are inspired by Math. For example, `Semigroup`
and `Monoid` are chiefly mathematical concepts. Formally, a Semigroup is
a set $S$ equipped with an operation $\cdot$, satisfying:

$$
x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y) \cdot z
$$

A Monoid is a Semigroup with an element $e$, serving as the identity element:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x \cdot e &= x \cr
e \cdot x &= x
\end{aligned}
$$

The `Eq` class is also inspired by Math. The `==` operator is modeled
over an *Equivalence Relation*, which is really just a mathematical definition
of the familiar notion of equality.

While `Ord`, technically speaking, doesn't specify any laws, we can model
the `Ord` typeclass after a *Partial Order*. This is a set $S$, equipped
with a relation $\leq$, satisfying:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&x \leq x \cr
&x \leq y, y \leq z \implies x \leq z
\end{aligned}
$$

The common thread here is that each of these classes correspond to some kind
of mathematical object, with corresponding laws.

## The Pragmatic Classes

The remaining classes we've seen are more loosely defined, and fall
into what I call the "pragmatic classes". The chief example here is
`Num`. These classes, as I see them, are about defining useful operations,
caring more about having a vector to provide operators, over
representing some kind of principled abstraction.

Very often, these are conceived of as providing a general class of types
that "behave like" some other concrete type. For example,
`Real` represents types that are essentially like the `Rational` type.

The disadvantage in this kind of class is that the operations involved
are often lawless, and sometimes instances have to cheat. Many `Num`
instances have to bend some of the rules a bit, since not all operations
make sense for that type. This happens because the Num abstraction is
an ad-hoc generalization of the well-known integer type, and not a
more principled collection of operations and laws.

# A Proposed Hierarchy

I don't think I've found the perfect solution to making a hierarchy
of numerical classes, nor do I think such a solution can be found,
but I do have a few ideas on making things a bit better.

Here's an alternative hierarchy of classes:

![](../Images/e82ea230911ca7e5ec1ff3053fb308a28750bd45837492ce3299ac88736c8dd4.png)

## Semigroup, Monoid

These are the same classes that we're used to, inspired
by the same mathematical objects:

```haskell
class Semigroup a where
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a

class Semigroup a => Monoid a where
  mempty :: a
```

## Group

Mathematically, a Group is a Monoid, where each element $a$
has an inverse $a^{-1}$, satisfying:

$$
a \cdot a^{-1} = e = a^{-1} \cdot a
$$

This leads to the following type-class:

```haskell
class Monoid a => Group a where
  negate :: a -> a
```

## Additive

Mathematically, this models an *Abelian Group*, which is just a group,
but where the group operation is commutative, i.e.:

$$
a \cdot b = b \cdot a
$$

It's common to use $+$ for the group operation instead.

This gives us the following typeclass:

```haskell
class Group a => Additive a where
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
```

This class serves to introduce the `+` operator, which has to be commutative.
The additional rule is that `+` and `<>` have to coincide.

We can also define:

```haskell
(-) :: Additive a => a -> a -> a
a - b = a + negate b
```

## Ring

Mathematically, a Ring is an Abelian Group, equipped with multiplication as well,
satisfying:

$$
a(b + c) = ab + ac
(b + c)a = ba + ca
1a = a = a1
$$

This gives us the following typeclass:

```haskell
class Additive a => Ring a where
  (*) :: a -> a -> a
  one :: a
```

satisfying the associated laws.

> [!note] **Note:**
> We don't necessarily assume that `*` is commutative here. You could add in an
> additional typeclass encoding this assumption.
> 
> In a dependently typed language, we might also be carrying out proofs of these properties,
> in addition to the operations themselves.

### Choosing Instances

Given some Ring, we have a Monoid instance, matching up with addition `+`. We might
also want to use multiplication instead, leading us to define the following wrapper:

```haskell
newtype Multiply m = Multiply m

instance Ring m => Semigroup (Multiply m) where
  (<>) = (*)

instance Ring m => Monoid (Multiply m) where
  mempty = one
```

We can use this wrapper to select the right version of Monoid, which is useful.

## Num

Now we move on from the nice mathematical classes, to the more pragamatic classes.

First, we have `Num`. Having already defined many ring operations, we're left with just:

```haskell
class Ring a => Num a where
  fromInteger :: Integer -> a
```

Note that we've taken the liberty of removing `abs` and `signum`, which aren't particularly
principled to begin with. If these are crucial, I would recommend either sticking them
in the `Integral` class, or creating an extra class after `Num`, to contain them.

We use the `Num` class to interpret numeric literals.

> [!note] **Note:**

> since Integers might be much too large for a given type. For example,
> converting `Integer` to `Int64` is going to fail for large numbers. Addressing
> this issue would be a good idea.

## Enum

This remains unchanged, although now we have an `Ord` requirement.
This makes sense in my view, since you can use the enumeration indices to compare two
elements, and this always makes sense.

## Real

For `Real`, the idea is unchanged. We have a class that represents the ability
to convert to rational numbers.

## Integral

This works the same way as it did previously, with conversions back to integers,
and the corresponding division operations defined therein.

### Roundtripping

Given that `Integral` implies `Num`, it might be a good idea to add an additional law,
specifying that the behavior of the newly added division operators can be derived
through first converting to `Integer`, performing the operation there,
and then converting back to the original type.

# Conclusion

I'm not entirely satisfied with the tail end of the hierarchy, and I wonder
if a better approach to the so-called "pragmatic classes" might exist.

Another big hole I've left is conversions that might possibly fail. For example,
converting large integer types into smaller integer types.

That being said, I'm pretty happy with the algebraic side of things, and I really
think that the addition of Groups would be quite useful, given how
much love Monoids have seen so far.
