This is a post going over the basic concept of
defining objects through **Universal Properties**,
in Category Theory, with explanations and examples in Haskell.

<!--more-->

Universal Properties allow us to characterize objects not
by their internal structure, or some kind of internal description,
but in the unique way they relate to other things. This kind of description
is powerful, because it shifts the focus from the content of each object,
to how different objects relate to eachother. This is the focus
of Category Theory more generally.

# The Basics

The usual way of defining an object through a Universal Property
goes something like this. You're working in some category $\mathcal{C}$.
You can characterize some universal object $U$ in terms of how it relates to
other objects. Usually this means that you have a unique morphism *into*
or *out of* $U$ making some kind of diagram commute.

You can think of this as saying that $U$ is the "best way" to
solve some kind of problem.

I'm obviously being a bit vague here, but examples will follow shortly.

## Initial

Let's make this much more concrete. Our first universal object is
that of an **Initial Object**. This object is characterized as follows:

An object $X$ is initial in $\mathcal{C}$ precisely when
there exists a unique morphism $U \to A$ for every other object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$.

We have some kind of diagram like this:

for any choice of $A$.

### With $\bold{Set}$

Now, let's make things even more concrete, and pick a specific category:
$\bold{Set}$. This is the category with sets as objects,
and normal functions as morphisms.

Does this category have an initial object?

Yes! $\emptyset$ is in fact the initial object. This is because
we can define a function $\emptyset \to A$ for any other object $A$.
A function $B \to C$ is really an assignment of a one
element of $C$ for each element of $B$. If you pick $c \in C$
for each element $b \in B$, then you have a function. Since the empty
set has no elements, we don't have any choices to make, so we're done!

### In Haskell

There's a "category" $\bold{Hask}$ of Haskell types and functions.
You can basically take this category as being equivalent
to $\bold{Set}$. Naturally, the "empty type" is going to be initial
in $\bold{Hask}$:

```haskell
data Void
```

This is the empty type, since there's no way to construct it.
How do we create a map to any other type?

```haskell
absurd :: Void -> a
absurd _ = let a = a in a
```

Now, we cheat here by creating an infinite loop, but notice
that it's not actually possible to end up in the infinite loop.
To do so, you'd have to produce a value of type `Void`,
which is impossible!

## Terminal

The dual notion to an *initial* object is a *terminal* object. Instead
of having a unique map *from* our object. we have a unique map *to* our object:

![](../Images/0d7b8cbfe734c27c9750b42456717e8c74c5b4e68bde6e6ab00d6c25293a6c5d.png)

In $\bold{Set}$, this object is the set with a single element:
$\bullet := \{\bullet\}$.

Given some other set $A$, we define our unique map $f$ as:

$$
f(a) = \bullet
$$

### In Haskell

This translates straightforwardly to Haskell. Here,
the type with a single element is `()`. Our universal map
is defined in a similar way:

```haskell
f :: a -> ()
f _ = ()
```

## Uniqueness

Can there be more than one initial or terminal object?

Yes, but that object *must* be isomorphic to the initial / terminal object.

Let's prove this for initial objects. Let's say we have
two objects $U, U'$ satisfying the initiality property.

We have unique maps $f : U \to U'$ and $f^{-1} : U \to U'$ between
them. We can compose these to give us maps $f ; f^{-1} : U \to U$,
and $f^{-1} ; f : U' \to U'$. But, the identity functions $1_U : U \to U$ and
$1_{U'} : U' to U'$ are also maps. But, since any function
out of $U$ or $U'$ must be unique, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f ; f^{-1} &= 1 \cr
f^{-1} ; f &= 1 \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

which is precisely the condition for $f$ to be an isomorphism.

This can be summarized concisely by the following commutative diagram:

![](../Images/9c14600171406285b7f203781003de8fa3f632b18032bb54c07d0a9f5173ecd7.png)

This proof can be reused almost piecemeal to show
that terminal objects are unique up to isomorphism
as well.

## Universal Representation

The implication of this fact is that any representation
of a type defined by a universal property is isomorphic.

For example, let's take the terminal object `()`. We
can represent this *using the property itself*!

```haskell
data Terminal where
  Terminal :: forall a. a -> Terminal
```

Now, we're using GADT syntax, because it makes this construction
very clear. We have a function to convert an `a`
into `Terminal`, given any type `a`. In practice, this is an
*existential type*. Given an element of `Terminal`,
we have some `a`, but we don't know what type it actually had. It could
have been anything.

Of course, since this encodes the universal property, it must be isomorphic to `()`:

```haskell
iso1 :: Terminal -> ()
iso1 _ = ()

iso2 :: () -> Terminal
iso2 _ = Terminal ()
```

We can do the same trick for the initial object `Void`:

```haskell
data Initial where
  Initial :: (forall a. a) -> Initial
```

We'd like to encode this as `forall a. Initial -> a`,
but we have to settle for the less intuitive `forall a. a`.
The idea is that given some instance of `Initial`,
we have an element `a`, for any type of `a`.

As expected, we have an isomorphism:

```haskell
iso1 :: Initial -> Void
iso1 (Initial v) = v

iso2 :: Void -> Initial
iso2 v = Initial (absurd v)
```

# Products

The familiar product `(a, b)` is also characterized by a universal property!
Notably, for any other type `Z` with projectors `Z -> a`,
and `Z -> b`, there's a unique morphism `Z -> (a, b)` making the following commute:

![](../Images/e818b998b13a1092a20f0010e32daef7fc2acb6feb655346185b6c4cdbecf7c6.png)

One way of thinking about this is that `(a, b)` is the simplest
way of making a type that can project
onto both `a`, and `b`. We have no extra information whatsoever.
If we did have some extra information, say:

```haskell
data User a b = User
  { name :: String,
    a :: a,
    b :: b
  }
```

We could always just pluck out the projections:

```haskell
pluck (User _ a b) = (a, b)
```

We can define our "universal product" directly with the same technique's we've seen
earlier:

```haskell
data Product a b where
  Product :: forall z. (z -> a) -> (z -> b) -> z -> Product a b
```

For any type `z`, if you have a projector to `a` and `b`,
then you have a function `z -> Product a b`, by the universal property.

This is isomorphic to the standard product `(a, b)`:

```haskell
iso1 :: Product a b -> (a, b)
iso1 (Product fst' snd' z) = (fst' z, snd' z)

iso2 :: (a, b) -> Product a b
iso2 tuple = Product fst snd tuple
```

# Sums

We can also encode the sum `Either a b` using a similar universal property.
The definining characteristic of `Either a b` is that we can construct
it from an `a`, or a `b` alone. Now, there might be other types
that we can make with an `a` or a `b`, but `Either a b` is the simplest one.

Formally, for any other type `z`, with a constructor `a -> z` and `b -> z`,
you have a function `Either a b -> z`, making the following diagram commute:

![](../Images/3894fe87ab76a677de3bebcdd24f7b6fa52a8b31cf43792d217f718fc98ac9ed.png)

The intuition is the `Either a b` is the smallest type in which
we can embed both elements of `a` and `b`. There might be larger
types in which this embedding is possible, but we can
always go through `Either a b` to make this embedding happen.



Using our standard trick, we can encode `Either a b` as a universal property

```haskell
data CoProduct a b where
  CoProduct :: (forall z. (a -> z) -> (b -> z) -> z) -> CoProduct a b
```

In some sense, this type is the "opposite", or *dual*
to the `Product` we saw earlier, which is why it's sometimes called
the **CoProduct**.

Once again, it's easy to show that an isomorphism exists:

```haskell
iso1 :: CoProduct a b -> Either a b
iso1 (CoProduct f) = f Left Right 

iso2 :: Either a b -> CoProduct a b
iso2 (Left a) = CoProduct (\l _ -> l a)
iso2 (Right b) = CoProduct (\_ r -> r b)
```

# Conclusion

This was just a quick post to go over the basics of
objects defined using *universal properties*, along
with some examples of encoding them in Haskell.

The main weakness of this approach is that we can't capture properties
that aren't structural. For example, we have a functions $f : A \to W$,
and $g : B \to W$, and we want to find the subset of the product $(A, B)$,
such that $\pi_A : f = \pi_B : g$ (this is called the pullback),
then our universal representation fails to capture this property,
since this isn't encoded structurally.

Anyways, there's a lot more to explore, but I wanted to get some of the basics
out there in a quick post.
