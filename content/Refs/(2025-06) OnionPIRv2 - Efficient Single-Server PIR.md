# Abstract

> This paper presents OnionPIRv2, an efficient implementation of OnionPIR incorporating standard orthogonal techniques and engineering improvements.  OnionPIR is a single-server PIR scheme that improves response size and computation cost by utilizing recent advances in somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) and carefully composing two lattice-based SHE schemes to control the noise growth of SHE. OnionPIRv2 achieves $2.5$x-$3.6$x response overhead for databases with moderately large entries (around $4$ KB or above) and up to $1600$ MB/s server computation throughput.
