# Abstract

> The transition to post-quantum cryptography involves balancing the long-term threat of quantum adversaries with the need for post-quantum algorithms and their implementations to gain maturity safely. Hybridization, i.e. combining classical and post-quantum schemes, offers a practical and safe solution.
> 
> We introduce a new security notion for hybrid signatures, Hybrid EU-CMA, which captures cross-protocol, separability, and recombination attacks that may occur during the post-quantum transition, while encompassing standard unforgeability guarantees.
> Using this framework, we adapt the Fiat-Shamir (with or without aborts) transform to build hybrid signature schemes that satisfy our notion from two identification schemes.
> Compared to simple concatenation of signatures, our construction (i) has no separability issues, (ii) reduces signature size, (iii) runs faster, and (iv) remains easily implementable.
> 
> As a concrete application, we propose Silithium, a hybrid signature combining the identification schemes underlying EC-Schnorr and ML-DSA.
> Implementing Silithium requires only an ML-DSA implementation supporting the ``external $\mu$'' option during verification and an elliptic curve library.
> In the security analysis, we show that our scheme can be safely used along with ML-DSA and either EC-Schnorr or ECDSA.
> A proof-of-concept OpenSSL implementation demonstrates its practicality, simplicity, and performance.
