# Abstract

> Despite the growing popularity of blockchains, their scalability remains a significant challenge. Layer-2s (L2s) aim to address this by introducing an operator to process transactions off-chain and post compact summaries to the Layer-1 (L1). However, existing L2 designs struggle with unsatisfactory throughput improvements, complex exit games, limited data availability, or high computational overhead for users.
> 
> This paper introduces PlasmaFold, a novel L2 designed to overcome these limitations. PlasmaFold utilizes a hybrid architecture: an operator (aggregator) generates proofs on server side for the honest construction of blocks, while users maintain balance proofs on their own devices. This separation of concerns enables instant, non-interactive exits via balance proofs, while block proofs handle most of the validations, minimizing usersâ€™ costs. By leveraging Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC), PlasmaFold achieves concrete efficiency. Users can update their balance proofs within a browser in under 1 second per transaction using less than 1 GB of RAM. Furthermore, only the identities of users who have acknowledged data receipt are posted to L1, ensuring data availability with a minimal on-chain footprint. This design keeps L1 costs extremely low, enabling a theoretical throughput of over 14000 transactions per second.
