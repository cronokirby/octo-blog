# Abstract

> We provide minimal counterexamples for the security of the BitVM3 garbling scheme: our attack allows the evaluator to forge input and output wires. Then we use the same idea to exhibit an attack on the forward label propagation garbling scheme proposed in a more recent paper. In both cases, the authenticity property of the garbling scheme is broken.
