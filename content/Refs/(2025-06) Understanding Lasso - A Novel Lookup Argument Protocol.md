# Abstract

> In 2023, Srinath Setty, Justin Thaler, and Riad Wahby published a paper that describes a novel lookup argument with efficient verification called Lasso. We present a focused and accessible overview of the Lasso lookup argument that stands for the foundational component of the Jolt ZK-VM. This article distills the core principles behind Lasso: the sum-check protocol, multilinear polynomials and their extensions, Spark commitment, offline memory-checking, and the evolution of Spark called Surge. By clarifying the underlying protocols and their relationship to innovations like Spark and Surge, we aim to provide researchers and engineers with practical insights into the cryptographic foundations powering both Lasso and the Jolt virtual machine.
