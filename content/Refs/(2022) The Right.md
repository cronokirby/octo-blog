A dense history of “the right” (meaning, in practice, the Republican Party and its tributaries), from the 1920s until the 2020s. Very well-researched, but at times can feel like a listing off of various names with a small blurb of what book, idea, or speech they might have contributed, without much coherence. I would have liked to see a higher level analysis of the currents and organization of the ecosystem, perhaps even with broader philosophical implications as to how political movements are constituted and evolve. This is a supremely difficult task, and beyond the scope of the book. In its current form, it’s still eminently useful as a reference to learn about important figures and their contributions throughout the decades.
