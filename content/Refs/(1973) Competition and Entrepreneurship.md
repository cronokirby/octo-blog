An [[Austrian Economics]] book criticizing [[Equilibrium Price Theory|equilibrium price theory]], in favor of a process view of the economy, centering the role of [[Entrepeneurial Action|entrepeneurial action]] in the dynamics of the market. With profit as a motive, this action coordinates and synchronizes information in the economy, and drives changes in the products available, and the prices they command.

While the core insight of the book is important, and the examples it gets applied to are interesting, the writing itself is belabored: the core insight is frequently repeated without any new addition, and the topics of particular chapters are often strayed from to merely repeat the core insight. The book remains short, so itâ€™s certainly worth a read, perhaps skipping over some of the more repetitive sections.
