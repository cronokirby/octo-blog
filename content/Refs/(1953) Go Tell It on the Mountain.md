A powerful, semi-autobiographical novel by [[James Baldwin]], exploring the themes of family, religion, and race, in the early 20th century.

I was very moved by this book. Its prose was lyrical at times, with vivid descriptions supporting a rich and emotional narrative. The author does an amazing job of conveying the feelings, emotions, and inner life of the characters in the novel, to the point where you feel as if you’re truly experiencing the world through their own eyes. The characters are very human, very imperfect, and it can be heart wrenching at times to watch them falter. The novel’s ambiguity about religion leaves a lasting impression, at times portraying the raw force of religion, but also laying its hypocrisy bare.
