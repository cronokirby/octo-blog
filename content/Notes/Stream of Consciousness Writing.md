A writing technique which presents narration is if coming from the thoughts of a particular person. Almost like trying to let the reader sit inside that personâ€™s head, and observe their thoughts as they pass by.

This can entail a looser structure in writing. Events may not proceed chronologically, and emotional perception can take precedence over an accurate perception of events.
