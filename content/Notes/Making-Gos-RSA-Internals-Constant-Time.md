This is essentially a lab notebook, while trying to move Go's
`crypto/rsa` module away from the variable-time `math/big.Int`, to an
internal constant-time number type.

## Necessary Methods

Key generation is out of the scope for now, and substantially more
complicated compared to encryption and decryption.
For implementing these, we only need:

- `CmpGeq`
- `CmpZero`
- `ModInv` *(Only if we use blinding)*
- `ModExp`
- `ModMul`
- `ModAdd`
- `ModSub`

If we implement constant-time operations, we can get rid of blinding,
and this provides additional incentive, since we don't need
to implement modular inversion, and can remove the blinding logic.

## Internal APIs

Internal APIs often use `big.Int`, and could be shifted to use
our internal type. The public API still needs to use `big.Int` though,
for compatability.

This would help with some leakages actually, because using `big.Int`
leaks zero padding information.

The concern here is the complexity of making this change.

## Unsaturated vs Saturated limbs

Using 63 bit limbs instead of 64 seems to be noticeably (~1.8x) faster
for montgomery multiplication, and thus for exponentiation.

We have `5215 ns/op` for saturated, and `2851 ns/op` for unsaturated.

## Using `uint`

Using `uint` as our word type lets us call `bits.Add` and `bits.Mul`
directly, which is a bit nicer. The downside is that we have less
control over using a wrapper type, or using `uint64`.

## Modular addition with and without scratch

```
BenchmarkModAdd-4                       10874287               103.3 ns/op
BenchmarkModAddWithScratch-4            10834304               107.2 ns/op
```

I prefer without scratch anyways, so this is good news.

Without the CRT stuff, things are much slower, but general modular reduction
is required to do the CRT, so implemented that will take more work.
